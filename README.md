Hello this is an old project I made for Secondary School coursework. It was made before I was familiar with Git so I did not initially publish it here while i was coding it
which is why the bulk of the code was added in one commit. Feel free to download the game and play it by running main.py. Instructions are below.

Welcome to Volatile Void and thank you for playing!
The aim of the game is to accumulate as much score as possible each run by defeating enemies.
Becareful not to take too long though or the difficulty will increase!

CONTROLS: 
- W: move up
- A: move right
- S: move down
- D: move right
- Tapping spacebar: shoot one projectile
